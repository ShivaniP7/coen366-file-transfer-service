To run and test our program:

1) run server
	press 1 to see binary request and response and 0 to not see it
2) run client
	press 1 to see binary request and response and 0 to not see it
3)input instruction you want into client and press enter
	if instruction is possible, you will get a message back saying it worked or didn't
4) to test again, stop running server and client, and restart from test 1

*our project file has a folder for client and a folder for server that both includes its own .txt files for you to test from. Please try sending them back and forth and renaming them, this was done for testing purposes so you can see how files actually are uploaded/download, and changed.
